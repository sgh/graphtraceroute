GraphTraceroute
###############

graphtraceroute is a program that can combine the output of "traceroute" from
severeal hosts. Of the hosts are supplied using http://, ftp:// or any other
"wget"-compatible URL the named file will be fetched to measure the speed.

Route-list and downlaod speeds is output in a dot-file.

Compiling
=========

$ make


Requirements
============

The application requires "wget" and "mtr" to be installed on the system.


Basic usage
===========

GraphTraceroute is executed from the commandline. You must supply it with a
file containing the URLS to fetch and trace or just bare hostname if you only
want a trace.

$ ./graphtraceroute -f myurls.lst -o myurls.dot

$ dot -Tpng myurls.dot -o myurls.png

Now you should have a nice png containing the graph of the traceroute to all
hosts listed in "myurls.lst"

To list available commandline options use the "-h" argument

$ ./graphtraceroute -h


Storing and using trace-files
=============================

You can store the meassured speeds and routes for later replay and correlation
against other runs. To store a trace use the "-t" argument, like this.

$ ./graphtraceroute -f myurls.lst -o myurls.dot -t myurls.trace

This will gerenate the DOT-output as before but also "myurls.trace" containing
speeds and routes.

To use stored traces to generate DOT-output you can ommit the "-f" parameter.

$ ./graphtraceroute -o myurls.dot -r myurls.trace -r someotherurls.trace

This will generate DOT-output from the traces in "myurls.trace" and "someotherurls.trace"
